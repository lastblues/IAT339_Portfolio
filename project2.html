        <h3> Be Human</h3>
        <p>"Be Human" was the final  project of the computer animation course at SFU (IAT 343) course.  "Be Human" is a 3D adaptation of a League of Legends comic of the same title. The story features two robot characters, "Orianna" and "Blitcrank", where they question what it means to be a human. </p>
        <p>My role in our 4 man team was modelling the character "Blitzcrank", animating the models according to the drawn storyboard and producing the animation through editing and post-production.</p>
        <p>Our goal was to convey a message of being kind to each other to promote League of Legend's philosophy of good player behavior. </p>

      </div>
      <p>The idea for the animation was conceived from a fan-comic found on a Korean League of Legends portal site. Our group's task was to animate and bring life to the story presented in the fan-comic.</p>

         <p>My task was modelling the character "Blitzcrank". Because there are not good images to reference model from, I decided to model by eyeballing it; meaning that I would have a picture of Blitzcrank as I eyeball the shape and scale of the different parts of the model.</p>
         <p>The 1st iteration of the model was based on the in-game models of the actual game. This way, I was able to capture the iconic features of Blitzcrank such as the gargantuan fists and large bolts and pipes shown through out his body. During the 2nd iteration, I made a modification to the shoulder area to allow for more arm movements without having clipping issues or parts of the model being suspended in mid-air during an animation. It also added some originality to the model as well.</p>

       </div>
       <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p>After all the models were created, everything was brought together in a singular file where another member and I animated the two different parts; new scenes we thought of and the scenes portrayed in the comic strip. My part was animating the original scenes in the comic book strip. Once the animatons were set in place, I created a particle effect to create snow within the environment to create the iconic scene in the comic book strip. </p>
         <p>When everything that could be done in Maya was complete, I rendered out all the scenes to be put in post production. In the final video, I created just past 2 minutes of animation. The final footage was imported into Adobe Premiere where the group edited the footage, along with all the sound effects and background music, to complete the final video.</p>
